# Deltarune Soundtrack (Beep Conversion)

Well, this is just one song converted, The World Revolving. I actually tried to make it sound good this time.\
The part after the intro is pretty good (imo).\
I tried to make it a bit better by shortly playing notes shifted an octave down. I personally have mixed feelings about it. Sometimes it sounds ok and other times it sounds terrible. But I feel like it adds a little bit of depth into the song.

# Undertale Soundtrack (Beep Conversion)

A full conversion of the **Undertale OST** into PC speaker-style `beep` commands.  
This is an automated conversion using MIDI files and has not been manually edited or cleaned up.

> ⚠️ **This is just a raw conversion — it mostly doesn’t sound good.**  
> I didn’t manually modify or optimize the output in any way.
